1. What is Git? is a distributed version control system which allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without interfering it with each otherâ€™s work
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git runs locally on your computer. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories. Git and GitHub enable multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without conflicts
3. Importance of Git/GitHub; enable multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without conflicts. Track changes, revert to previous versions, and understand the history of a project.
4. Examples of Git Best Practices: Make small, frequent commits with meaningful messages. Provide context about what changes were made and why.
5. working directory is the local workspace where you make changes to your project files
6. Local repository stored on your local machine. It contains the project's history and allows you to make changes offline. 
7. A remote repository hosted on a server allows multiple developers to collaborate and share changes. 8. A staging area is where changes are listed before they are committed. 
9. Git Init command initializes a new Git repository in the current directory, creating the necessary metadata files and directories for version control
10. Git Clone creates a copy of a remote repository on your local machine, including all files, commit history, and branches.
12. Git Pull fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into your current branch. It's a combination of git fetch and git merge.
13. git config command is used to configure Git settings, such as user information (name and email), default editor, and repository-specific configurations. It can set configuration at different levels: system, global, and local.
14. A commit message is a brief description that explains the changes made in a particular commit. It helps other developers understand the context and purpose of the changes.
15. Advantages of Distributed Version Control; Every developer has a full copy of the repository, including the history, enabling work offline and improving fault tolerance. Multiple developers can work independently and merge changes later, facilitating parallel development
